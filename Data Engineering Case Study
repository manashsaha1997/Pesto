Data Ingestion:

Technology Stack: Apache Kafka can be used as a central streaming platform to ingest data in real-time. Separate topics can be created for ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro).
Real-time Processing: Stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming can be used to process data as it arrives in Kafka. These frameworks can parse the data based on its format (JSON, CSV, Avro), perform basic transformations like schema validation and timestamp normalization, and push the data to a data lake for further processing.
Batch Processing: For historical data or data arriving in batches, tools like Apache Airflow or Luigi can be used to schedule data ingestion jobs. These jobs can leverage libraries like PySpark or Pandas to read data from cloud storage (e.g., S3) or on-premise data stores, perform similar transformations, and write the data to the data lake.
Data Processing:

Data Lake: A data lake like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage can be used to store all the ingested data in its raw format. This allows for future exploration and analysis without worrying about the original data format.
Data Transformation: Spark jobs can be used to read data from the data lake, perform more complex transformations like data cleansing, deduplication (removing duplicate clicks/impressions), and enrichment (adding user segments based on bid request data).
Correlation: Spark jobs can further process the data to join impressions with clicks and conversions based on user ID and timestamps. This will allow for calculating key campaign metrics like click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate.
Data Storage and Query Performance:

Data Warehouse: A data warehouse like Snowflake or Redshift can be used to store the processed and enriched data. The data warehouse should be designed with a star schema or snowflake schema to optimize analytical queries and aggregations of ad campaign data.
Denormalization: Denormalization techniques can be applied when storing data in the data warehouse to improve query performance for specific use cases. For example, pre-aggregating campaign metrics by day or week can significantly speed up reporting.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Data Validation: Schema validation should be implemented during data ingestion to ensure data consistency and identify potential issues early on.
Monitoring: Stream processing frameworks and Spark jobs can be configured to monitor data quality metrics like data volume, schema compliance, and data freshness. Alerts can be sent to notify data engineers about any anomalies or discrepancies.
Data Lineage: Tools like Apache Atlas can be used to track the lineage of data throughout the processing pipeline. This helps identify the source of any data quality issues and facilitates faster troubleshooting.
Additional Considerations:

Security: Implement data security best practices including access control, data encryption, and activity logging to protect sensitive advertising data.
Scalability: The chosen technologies and infrastructure should be scalable to handle increasing data volumes and user base growth.
Cost Optimization: Techniques like data partitioning and compression can be used to optimize storage costs in the data lake and data warehouse.
